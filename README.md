# 📚 Data Structures Practice Projects

This repository contains simple Python implementations of classic data structure exercises and algorithms done as part of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## 🔧 Implementations included

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `linked_list/` | Singly linked list with basic operations |
| `queue_linked_list/` | Queue using linked list (enqueue, dequeue) |
| `stack_array/` | Stack using array (push, pop, peek) |
| `doubly_linked_list/` | Doubly linked list implementation |
| `circular_queue/` | Circular queue using array |
| `binary_search/` | Binary Search algorithm |
| `recursion_examples/` | Basic recursion examples (factorial, fibonacci) |

## 🧠 Goal

To understand how data structures work internally by implementing them manually in Python.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Concepts: OOP, Pointers (via references), Recursion, Lists, Complexity

---

## ⚠️ Note

These implementations are made for educational purposes during my **Data Structures course**.
